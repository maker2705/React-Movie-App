# ReactProjects
This repository houses a diverse collection of my React projects, showcasing a progression from fundamental concepts to sophisticated applications. It serves as a portfolio of my React development journey, encompassing projects of varying complexity and scope.



## Table of Contents
   **Project 1 - Movies web app**


## Description
In this repository, you'll find a variety of React projects that I have worked on to learn and practice different aspects of React development. Each project folder contains a separate README file with details about the project and its features.

## Projects List

 **Project 1 - Basic Movie App**


### Getting Started
Each project folder contains its own **README** file with instructions on how to run the project locally. You can follow the steps provided in the specific project's README to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Contributions
**At this time, I am not accepting contributions to this repository. It is intended for personal use and to showcase my individual projects.**

### Usage
Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference or learning tool. However, please note that the code and projects are provided as-is, and I am not responsible for any issues that may arise from using or modifying them.


### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
